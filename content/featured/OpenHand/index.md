The OpenHand application is built on top of the full-body pose estimator [OpenPose](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose). It eases hand keypoints datasets creation and poses classification live experiments. You can also integrate your own TensorFlow model trained on the available dataset of more than two dozen categories.
