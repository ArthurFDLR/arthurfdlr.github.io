[Black-Out Challenge](https://www.safran-group.com/media/love-challenge-here-safran-we-do-too-20200204): All GNSS systems are down. Air, sea, and road traffic are severely affected!

The GooseNav project aims at restoring an absolute positioning system combining dead-reckoning, beaconing, and a network of users sharing their live position estimates.
