How to develop a race track generator in 3 easy steps:

1. Extract tracks from [Matt Dunlop's poster](https://www.redbubble.com/i/poster/Race-Tracks-to-Scale-Plain-Layouts-by-SirDunny/11752820.LVTDI) using a custom boundary following algorithm.
2. Compute their Fourier descriptors to optimize representation.
3. Design a low complexity GAN.
